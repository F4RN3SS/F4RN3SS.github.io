<strong><h2 class="thistitle">Offended:Resentful or annoyed, typically as a result of a perceived insult.(By google)<br>
Offended:Getting way too annoyed cause you can’t fight back and like a scaredy cat going to the teacher for a chance of a complain.(By me)<br>
Note:This is a book insulting people who get offended for absolutely no reason.
Side note:My grammar is trash…please don’t bully me for that.
OK,so now that we have that out of the way let’s start…</h2>
<h1 class="thistitle" id="part1isthis"><center>Part 1</center></h1>
<h2 class="thistitle">So I have experienced a lot of butthurt/offended people(Even though I am 12 years old and a kid).
I am the kind of guy who is I GUESS chill all the time.
I don’t care what you say to me cause I won’t take it seriously.So most of the time i get real annoyed from this one guy in my class(No name pointing here!)<br> and he thinks he is very cool but actually he is dumb as hell(Lowkey roasted).He just goes to the teacher and says pointless things that even confuses the<br> teacher.Including him most of the offended people I have experienced are like that or some of them are just ‘Extraordinary’(Yea there was a reason behind those quotes)</h2>                                    
<h1 class="thistitle" id="part2isthis"><center>Part 2</center><h1>
<h2 class="thistitle">Ya so you might be wondering why I wrote this on the third day,well who cares.So as I was saying about offended people last time, I gotta continue with this nonsense.So offended people for the most part have a reason for what their saying(But you might be thinking why am I defending those people) well am actually not saving them am just telling the truth, some of em have a reason.SO BACK TO THE TOPIC.Sometimes when people get offended just cause I said somethin different which is actually funny(For the most part)and they will react as if I just attacked them in the gut with a katana.So offended people as you might be thinking right now, are my “Worst nightmare”…and I am never ready for an encounter against them,especially some in my class(The ones god has personally touched)…</h2>
<h1 class="thistitle" id="part3isthis"><center>Part 3</center></h1>

<h2 class="thistitle">So like the last or second last day before winter vacation there is a girl in my class who was talking some smack…
Like we were asking about getting our hindi paper and somebody was saying something that wasn’t quite respectful but in a joke,so me as well said why you being<br> so disrespectful ”In a joke”…But “Plot twist” this girl said that who are you calling someone disrespectful,(Wait a sec…side note here she actually said that cause I make fun of her vigourous attitude) and I am like…”Dramatic sound” Dun dun dun #BoycottThatGirl.Ya so that is the story of offended people for today.Tomorrow I will be talking about someone else stupid in my class and remember, it is not pointing towards anyone.It is just a joke just like my life XD XD. </h2>
<h1 class="thistitle" id="part4isthis"><center>Part 4</center></h1>
<h2 class="thistitle">Yea so lets continue…So I don’t quite have to go through someone each day who is annoying as hell but sometimes my luck is just bad and I do have a handful of people in my class who are like that.So I have a girl in my class(No name cause if I do name her I will be in deep trouble),So she is kind of a feministand kind of like, you know those cool kids who are like daredevils and will just answer anything in such a cool way to the teacher,and then go to their other friends and start telling em how cool they are.So I did kind of explain her cool part which is kind of annoying but is okay I mean I can handle it but the way that she speaks yea that part that part is super annoying and not bareable,she speaks kind of like beyonce like a feminist and is like boys are not as good as girls and she doesn’t care about the conversation, she will say this anytime out of the ordinary.I couldn’t come up with enough factors to insult that kid so I deleted that part and don’t wanna share my fails…</h2>
<center><h1 class="thistitle" id="part5isthis">Nothing just a note from me:</h1></center>
<h2 class="thistitle">So I would like to address somethings before the end of the book…
1.Firstly, that I am writing this after new year cause I was very sick.
2.The main reason I thought of writing this is because I thought that the book needed an end and this would be the best way to do that thing.
3.So one more thing I would like to tell is that my book was super cringey and I am sorry about that cause I am actually completely against cringe content and I am quit ashamed of myself and will try to improve lol.I would like to say that again I read my book and it is not quite cringey what the hell me,ok that line was cringey,honestly it is your choice.
4.So that is it and I don’t wanna tag anything for clout this is just a book from my heart giving hate to every easily offendable person in my life.
And I hope you have a great day and thanks a lot for reading my book I really really appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.
